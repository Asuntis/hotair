              <b>Flight Cancellations</b>
              <div>               
                The cancellation guidelines for flights vary according to the terms and conditions established by each airline. While some airlines permit cancellations within specified timeframes, others impose restrictions or charges. It's essential to thoroughly examine the cancellation policies of the airline you intend to book with.

              <b>HotAir Cancellation Fees</b>
              <div>
                HotAir retains the authority to levy cancellation fees for flight bookings or related services rendered. These fees supplement any charges enforced by the airline. We advise reviewing the booking details attentively or contacting our customer support for clarification on potential cancellation fees.

              <div>               
                Refund eligibility due to cancellations is based on the airline's policies. Should a refund be feasible, HotAir will endeavor to accelerate the process. It's essential to acknowledge that specific bookings might be non-refundable, and the refund amount may be contingent upon the airline's terms and conditions.
